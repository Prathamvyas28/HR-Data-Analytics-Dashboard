Data Cleaning

Remove duplicates and irrelevant data.
Handle missing values by either imputing or removing them.
Standardize data formats for consistency (e.g., date formats, categorical data).
Data Sorting

Organize data into relevant categories (e.g., job titles, gender).
Create pivot tables to summarize data by various dimensions such as gender and job title.
Data Analysis
