# HR-Data-Analytics-Dashboard


## Problem Statement

Organizations often struggle to effectively analyze and visualize their human resources data to gain meaningful insights. This HR dashboard project addresses the need for a comprehensive and interactive tool that allows HR managers to:

- Analyze headcount by job title and gender distribution.
- Assess average salary and leave balance metrics.
- Understand the age distribution of the staff.
- Examine the relationship between salary and qualifications.
- Track cumulative headcount growth over time.


### Steps followed 

1) Data Collection: 
    - Gather data from HR information systems, including employee demographics, salaries, job titles, and dates of joining.
2) Data Cleaning: 
    
    - Remove duplicates and irrelevant data.  
    - Handle missing values by either imputing or removing them.
    - Standardize data formats for consistency (e.g., date formats, categorical data).
3) Data Sorting: 

    - Organize data into relevant categories (e.g., job titles, gender).
    - Create pivot tables to summarize data by various dimensions such as gender and job title.

4) Data Analysis:

    - Calculate key metrics such as average salary, headcount by gender, and age distribution.
    - Analyze the relationship between salary and qualifications.
    - Generate summary statistics and visualizations to identify trends and patterns.

5) Dashboard Design:

    - Used Power BI to create an interactive dashboard.
    - Incorporate visual elements such as bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots to effectively communicate insights.
    - Design summary cards for key metrics like headcount, average salary, and leave balance.

6) Insight Generation: 

    - Interpreted the visualized data to generate meaningful insights.
    - Identified trends and anomalies in the data that can inform HR strategies and decisions.


- Key Insights :

  1) Average Salary and Gender Distribution: 
       - The average salary is $54,000, with a headcount of 161 employees.
     - The gender distribution shows a slight majority of female employees at 54.66%.

  2) Age Distribution of Staff: 
        - The majority of the staff falls within the 20-30 age range, indicating a relatively young workforce.
  
  3) Salary vs. Qualification: 
        - There is a diverse range of salaries across different qualification levels, with Bachelor's and Master's degree holders earning higher salaries on average.
  
  4) Cumulative Headcount by Date of Join: 
        - The headcount has steadily increased over the years, reflecting organizational growth.
  
Conclusion:

- This HR Data Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive tool for analyzing key HR metrics. By visualizing data on headcount, salaries, gender distribution, and qualifications, HR managers can make informed decisions to optimize workforce management. The dashboard's interactive elements, such as filters and dynamic visualizations, allow for detailed exploration and targeted insights. This project demonstrates the value of data-driven decision-making in human resources and highlights the importance of effective data visualization in uncovering actionable insights.
